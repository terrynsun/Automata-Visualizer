Automata-Visualizer
===================

A simple visualizer for DFAs and NFAs. Eventual goals include more user
interactivity and a basic, visual regular expressions engine.

CURRENTLY:
- DFAs
- NFAs
- Basic Visualization
- Basic operations (concatenation, union)
- Regex, parsing only

TODO:
- visualization
  + better path drawing
  + better delay calculation
    + iteration in place of absolute delay calculation
- check for validity
- user input
  + pause
  + sanitation/check for validity
- regular Expressions
